Matrix Factorization Methods for Python (pymf) v. 0.1
=====================================================

What is PyMF?
-------------

Python Matrix Factorization (PyMF) is a module for several constrained/unconstrained 
matrix factorization (and related) methods. The module is early alpha and not very well 
tested.

PyMF currently includes the following methods:

    * Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
    * Convex non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF)
    * Semi non-negative matrix factorization (SNMF)
    * Archetypal analysis (AA)
    * Simplex volume maximization (SiVM)
    * Convex-hull non-negative matrix factorization (CHNMF)
    * Binary matrix factorization (BNMF)
    * Singular value decomposition (SVD)
    * Principal component analysis (PCA)
    * K-means clustering (Kmeans)
    * CUR decomposition (CUR)
    * Compaxt matrix decomposition (CMD)
